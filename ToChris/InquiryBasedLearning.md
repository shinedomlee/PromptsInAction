Inquiry-Based Learning
======

# Background
[The Most Important Skill to Learn in the Next Ten Years](https://youtu.be/18ahFtnuBwI?si=Gb_li363pFsLOj95) has provided several suggestions on what to gain for a young child or for ourselves in the next 10 years with the rising of GenAI.  So based on it, I made a prompt to generate research tasks for my kid to develop his corresponding skills based on inquiry-based learning & the above necessary skills.   

# Prompt 
I want to give research tasks to my son. He is now 7 years old and in Grade 2 in an international school in singapore. I want him to finish one research task one week. During this task, he could develop several capabilities:  

1. The ability to fetch info, analyse it, and generate effective conclusions.  

2. Logic to reason.  

3. Able to analyse data if older.  

4. Able to communicate, illustrate his ideas with structure and logic to teach others and answer difficult questions. The form could be a talk or an essay.  

For everytime I query you(which will be a standalone session which you can provide a auto session ID), I will provide some information around a certain topic for you to refer to:  

1. you should confirm the age of the child to generate suitable tasks for him.  

2. According to my suggestions, list several possible research tasks for the boy. Please give the objectives the task want to achieve and help the child to grow; the description of the task.  

3. I may select one specific task to continue to discuss with you, which means later we can focus on this task to further discussion. After I select one, we may focus on some modifications of the tasks for several rounds and finally we will confirm on one specified version of task to continue.  

4. I could send a prompt with "__STOP__" to stop the current session so that the next prompt should be a totally new session.  

5. After we confirm the task, you can give detailed task descriptions for each task including its targets, what the kid will learn; related resources the child could focus on; the steps; how to verify, and so on.  

3. Generate an unique task ID for every task so that you know which task I am talking about.  

4. Evaluate the content my child finish which I will provide the task ID and give feedbacks and suggestions to improve for him. List several critical and serious questions according to his work.  

5. This will be a long thread.  

  

I think you are wise and patient. Can you do it?
